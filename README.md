# Rock.
# Paper.
# Scissors.
Long ago, the three nations lived together in harmony. 

Then, everything changed when the Scissor Nation attacked. 
Only the Axe, master of all three elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. 
A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Axe, an Axe named Axe. And although his Axe skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. 
But I believe Axe can save the world.
